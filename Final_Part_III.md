## Summarizing the Process
In [Part I](https://jameson-c.github.io/viz-portfolio/Final_Part_I.html) I conducted extensive research on the history informing this project and established the plot arc I hoped to convey in this piece. I scoped out available data that could be used to tell the story, and produced some simple wireframes describing findings from the [Mapping Inequality](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=11/40.442/-80.172&city=pittsburgh-pa&text=downloads) data and an initial map. From here, I decided that a Shorthand story would best convey the points I was hoping to make.

In [Part II](https://jameson-c.github.io/viz-portfolio/Final_Part_I.html) I completed a draft Shorthand (which has since been overwritten by my final) and showed it to my target audience: CMU students. From this exercise, I collected some valuable feedback and decided to pursue the following changes for the final:
1.  Add a bit more text framing some of the content in case people are left wanting more. I started simple but it seems like people were interested in seeing more about the history, and potentially about the outcomes in the community.
2.  Improve the labels for the donut charts to make their points clearer.
3.  Do some intentional palette selection for colors to help marry the story across phases.
4.  Provide a bit more context about "Why Hazelwood?" as people seemed interested, but a bit surprised.
5.  Provide some more context for health outcomes in Black communities. Maybe another visualization of some variety.
6.  Explore the science of NO2 and potential main sources of asthma in Black communities. There are many other sources of pollution that cause asthma in these neighborhoods (such as highways) which are potential main sources. I might be making a leap here in terms of identifying the actual source, though there is research which affirms the link between redlining and asthma. 

Of these, I succeeded in all of these points except point 6. Some of the research papers I found supported the causal link between pollution and asthma in these communities, but I still feel that the location of factories might be tenuously linked to the outcomes I describe in this piece. There are a bunch of sources of pollution in the area that are miles away from redlined areas. There is no doubt in the literature I read that exposure to industrial pollution is higher in areas that were once redlined, but I am unsure about the actual source of that pollution. It could be that some of the factories I display in this map are not emitting anything harmful at all. On point 2, I ended up changing the visualization in the last minute away from donut charts. Instead I used a dot survey chart; that was muh easier to read and conveyed the points I was originally making with two separate charts, in one.
