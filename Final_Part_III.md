## Summarizing the Process
### Part I: Conceptualization
In [Part I](https://jameson-c.github.io/viz-portfolio/Final_Part_I.html) I conducted extensive research on the history informing this project and established the plot arc I hoped to convey in this piece. I scoped out available data that could be used to tell the story, and produced some simple wireframes describing findings from the [Mapping Inequality](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=11/40.442/-80.172&city=pittsburgh-pa&text=downloads) data and an initial map. From here, I decided that a Shorthand story would best convey the points I was hoping to make:
###### The Setup 
Many Black Pittsburghers continue to live in areas that were redlined in the 1930's. Here I draw the link between the past and the present.
###### The Conflict 
These ex-redlined areas also tend to be near industrial zones and so residents are disproportionately exposed to environmental toxins. Here I introduce the complexity of how redlining connects to industrial zoning.
###### The Resolution
Finally I reveal information about Black Pittsburghers' respiratory health from research out the University of Pittsburgh. This is where I try to marry the setup and conflict into a clear summary point. From here, I aimed to ask the reader to donate to environmental justice groups in the area, but did not have a specific one in mind. 
##### Original Data Points Used to Tell the Story
From the data, my original points were:
1. Areas with Black residents were given worse security grades by surveyors
2. Many of the mentions in surveyors' notes about smoke and pollution were in these same areas
3. Industries are still located in these areas
4. Black families still live in these areas
5. Black folks are disproportionately exposed to pollution

As my understanding of the data evolved, many of these data points shifted. My outline of the story arc, however, stayed pretty much exactly the same. This is because I had a decent sense of what I wanted to say, but a worse sense of how I could substantiate it in the data.

### Part II: User Research
In [Part II](https://jameson-c.github.io/viz-portfolio/Final_Part_I.html) I completed a draft Shorthand (which has since been overwritten by my final) and showed it to my target audience: CMU students. By then, I had explored the data more thoroughly and removed the map displaying the overlay of Black communities with redlined areas. This was because I felt that this element of the story was not responsible from a data quality standpoint: race data available from the ACS is reported at an entirely different geographic unit from the 1937 HOLC maps. 

Additionally, I moved away from the exposure concept, and instead focused on *outcomes* of pollution exposure in Black communities. My new charts wrapping up the latter half of the presentation were regarding child asthma rates and prevalence of asthma among Black residents of redlined areas. Finally, I decided that I wanted to support the Hazelwood Initiative because I visited the neighborhood for a CMU event, which discussed a bunch of these topics.

From the user research exercise, I collected some valuable feedback and decided to pursue the following changes for the final:
1.  Add a bit more text framing some of the content in case people are left wanting more. I started simple but it seems like people were interested in seeing more about the history, and potentially about the outcomes in the community.
2.  Improve the labels for the donut charts to make their points clearer.
3.  Do some intentional palette selection for colors to help marry the story across phases.
4.  Provide a bit more context about "Why Hazelwood?" as people seemed interested, but a bit surprised.
5.  Provide some more context for health outcomes in Black communities. Maybe another visualization of some variety.
6.  Explore the science of NO2 and potential main sources of asthma in Black communities. There are many other sources of pollution that cause asthma in these neighborhoods (such as highways) which are potential main sources. I might be making a leap here in terms of identifying the actual source, though there is research which affirms the link between redlining and asthma. 

### Part III: The Final Data Story
Of the changes suggested in [Part II](https://jameson-c.github.io/viz-portfolio/Final_Part_II.html) I succeeded in all of the points except point 6. Some of the research papers I found supported the causal link between pollution and asthma in these communities, but I still feel that the location of factories might be tenuously linked to the outcomes I describe in this piece. There are a bunch of sources of pollution in the area that are miles away from redlined areas. There is no doubt in the literature I read that exposure to industrial pollution is higher in areas that were once redlined, but I am unsure about the actual source of that pollution. It could be that some of the factories I display in this map are not emitting anything harmful at all. Still, I feel it is safe to say that the locations of these factories cannot be *helpful* and further that their locations were environmentally racist. On point 2, I ended up changing the visualization in the last minute away from donut charts. Instead I used a dot survey chart; that was muh easier to read and conveyed the points I was originally making with two separate charts, in one. 

Additionally, I made the choice to focus more intently on Hazelwood. Prior to the feedback in Part II and a discussion with a local activist who I ran this by, the mention of Hazelwood at the end of this presentation felt a bit forced. Now, Hazelwood demonstrates how these historical dynamics led to bad outcomes in Black communities. So the final mention of Hazelwood is more relevant and flows better with the overall arc. Though there are formerly redlined parts of Pittsburgh that are more immediately exposed to industrial pollution (the mill in Hazelwood was closed in the 1990's) I felt it was relevant to my audience due to the connection between CMU and the neighborhood. So I think that this shift in focus will probably better motivate my audience. 

Regarding design decisions, I felt that it was quite difficult formatting these visualizations in a manner that flowed with the story. By breaking the final piece into its three essential parts: history, impact, and then seeking justice with visual cues, I was able to signal each segment's tone. I received a comment in Part II that noted they liked the 'justice' section's flowers in the background. Finally, I do wish that I could have changed a few things. The boxplot displaying Hazelwood's demographics has some strange behavior where you have to click twice on the page for the annotation to appear. Further, I had issues perfecting formatting in Tableau. But overall, I think that the final piece told the story well:
