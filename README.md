# viz-portfolio
A collection of design exercises completed for Telling Stories with Data, a graduate-level data viz course at Carnegie Mellon University.

## About Me
My name is Jameson Carter and I am a researcher interested in civic technology. Prior to attending Carnegie Mellon, I worked for the [Congressional Research Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Research_Service), where I informed Congress on various issues facing low-income communities. There, I [wrote extensively](https://crsreports.congress.gov/search/#/?termsToSearch=Jameson%20Carter&orderBy=Relevance) on the intersections of federal programs and poverty alleviation. Through this work, I took a special interest in communicating data to broad audiences.

## What I Hope to Learn
Through this class I hope to learn how to incorporate design principles into my future visualizations. While working for CRS I made several okay-to-bad graphs although I learned a lot along the way. After graduating, I would like to apply data science to help communities solve problems equitably. Being able to communicate data scientific results visually is highly important to this sort of work.

## Portfolio
The following sections contain the work I completed for this course. 
## Assignment 1: Visualizing government debt in 2020
For this assignment, we were asked to use [Flourish](https://flourish.studio/) to generate some visualizations tracking government debt during 2020, a year of global pandemic, economic crisis, and governmental responses to those respective shocks. I figured it would be an interesting year to explore.

See the [following page](https://jameson-c.github.io/viz-portfolio/Assignments/assignment_1.html) for this exploration.

### Assignment 2
For this assignment, we were asked to redesign a chart that we felt could be improved. I made the brave choice to critique a bad chart that I made in my work with the Congressional Research Service.

See the [following page](https://jameson-c.github.io/viz-portfolio/Assignments/assignment_3_4.html) for this redesign.

### Final Project
My topic was environmental justice in Pittsburgh. For this project I explored the intersection of modern factory locations/pollution exposure with racist policies.
