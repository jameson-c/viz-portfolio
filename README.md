# About Me
My name is Jameson Carter and I am a researcher with a strong interest in civic technology. Prior to attending Carnegie Mellon, I worked for the [Congressional Research Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Research_Service), where I informed Congress on various issues facing low-income communities. There, I [wrote extensively](https://crsreports.congress.gov/search/#/?termsToSearch=Jameson%20Carter&orderBy=Relevance) on the intersections of federal programs and poverty alleviation. Through this work, I took a special interest in communicating data to broad audiences.

# What I Hope to Learn
Through this class, I hope to learn how to incorporate design principles into my future visualizations. While working for CRS I made several okay-to-bad graphs although I learned a lot along the way. After graduating, I would like to apply data science to help communities solve problems equitably. Being able to communicate data scientific results visually is highly important to this sort of work.

# Portfolio
The following sections contain the work I completed for this course. 
## Assignment 1: Visualizing government debt in 2020
For this assignment, we were asked to use [Flourish](Flourish.io) to generate some visualizations tracking government debt.

See the [following page](https://jameson-c.github.io/viz-portfolio/assignment_1.html) for this exploration.
