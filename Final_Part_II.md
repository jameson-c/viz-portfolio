## Wireframes and Storyboards
Using the graphs I considered in Part I of this process, I created the following draft:

## User Research
From here, I surveyed three of my classmates to determine:
* The target audience
* The success of my piece in targeting that audience
* Insights about data viz clarity etc.
### Student, 20s
#### Q1. How did this make you feel as you read this piece?
Interested, and like they wanted to learn more about the issue.
#### Q2. What do you think is going on here?
There are clearly lasting health impacts from policies made in the past 100 years. Those health impacts clearly have repercussions which disproportionately affect Black communities. And we need solutions to remove harmful pollutants from where people live.
#### Q3. Did you feel like you were looking at the graphs?
Yes, they were helpful.
#### Q4. Did any graphs feel unnecessary or confusing?
There was one map that was difficult to read. When I got to the map with the factories, I zoomed out because of the cursor. Some of the graphs needed more labeling.
#### Q5. Did anything surprise you?
I am well aware of the relationship between NO2 and asthma but was more unaware that it was related to industrial production. Moreso associated NO2 with home sources of pollution and cars and things like that.
#### Q6. What would you change, if you could change one thing?
Wanted a little more detail from the paragraph about zoning policies. Maybe this was too vague.

### Student, 30s
#### Q1. How did this make you feel as you read this piece?
It made me feel sad. It was disappointing to see the stats and think about it. But then I started to feel hopeful when the Justice Is Possible section came up.
#### Q2. What do you think is going on here?
Basically you are trying to publicize this organization that is working against environmental racism. Trying to motivate people to become a part of the solution.
#### Q3. Did you feel like you were looking at the graphs?
I was yeah. The graphs placement-wise were really nice. The timing of each graph was really nice. Some were confusing.
#### Q4. Did any graphs feel unnecessary or confusing?
The graph about redlined areas had a ‘yes/no’ pie chart, and it was difficult to understand what that was actually answering. It was unclear and hard to grasp.
#### Q5. Did anything surprise you?
On the overall issue no, but was surprised about black adults more likely to have asthma in redlined areas was surprising. Was surprised that it was roughly 50-50, still.
#### Q6. What would you change, if you could change one thing?
Excluding that zoom in / zoom out visual for the map. The grade labeling of the map was confusing. It seemed to convey too much information and needs to be simplified to make sense. The intention did not seem super clear.

### Student, 20s
#### Q1. How did this make you feel as you read this piece?
Bummed about America. Not until the very end did I feel hopeful but even then it seems like a larger issue than this small organization can provide.
#### Q2. What do you think is going on here?
It seemed like the transitions really stood out, the asthma rates really stood out as far as disparate outcomes.
#### Q3. Did you feel like you were looking at the graphs?
I feel like I looked at the graphs and the titles equally.
#### Q4. Did any graphs feel unnecessary or confusing?
Having different colors across the graphs might be helpful because there were colors that tracked across the graphs, but the concepts weren’t shared. Maybe pick more intentional colors unless you are using two consistent concepts.
#### Q5. Did anything surprise you?
The Hazelwood Initiative was new to me, I was not familiar with that. It was kind of a super local solution to a big problem.
#### Q6. What would you change, if you could change one thing?
Maybe this is just me, but I might change the white border with the yellow border differently. Making the white take up more space might make the background less distracting.
