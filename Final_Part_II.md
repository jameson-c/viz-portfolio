## Wireframes and Storyboards
Using the graphs I considered in Part I of this process, I created the following draft:

## User Research
From here, I surveyed three of my classmates to determine how I was interacting with:
* The target audience
* The success of my piece in targeting that audience
* Insights about data viz clarity etc.

For this piece, I was hoping to target Carnegie Mellon Students, as I get the sense that many students at CMU do not have connections with the community here. Carnegie Mellon itself is located in an area that profited from redlining: nearby Shadyside and other neighborhoods were either given an 'A' or 'B' grade and there are few industrial plants near campus. So, all three of my interviews were with fellow CMU students of different racial/gender identities. I hoped to see what people with different life experiences might glean from the piece. These interviews turned out to be quite useful.

After showing the wireframe/draft story, I asked the following questions:

| Question | Student, 20's | Student, 30's | Student, 20's |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| How did this make you feel as you read this piece? | Interested, and like they wanted to learn more about the issue. | It made me feel sad. It was disappointing to see the stats and think about it. But then I started to feel hopeful when the Justice Is Possible section came up. | Bummed about America. Not until the very end did I feel hopeful but even then it seems like a larger issue than this small organization can provide. |
| What do you think is going on here? | There are clearly lasting health impacts from policies made in the past 100 years. Those health impacts clearly have repercussions which disproportionately affect Black communities. And we need solutions to remove harmful pollutants from where people live. | Basically you are trying to publicize this organization that is working against environmental racism. Trying to motivate people to become a part of the solution. | It seemed like the transitions really stood out, the asthma rates really stood out as far as disparate outcomes. |
| Did you feel like you were looking at the graphs? | Yes, they were helpful. | I was yeah. The graphs placement-wise were really nice. The timing of each graph was really nice. Some were confusing. | I feel like I looked at the graphs and the titles equally. |
| Did any graphs feel unnecessary or confusing? | There was one map that was difficult to read. When I got to the map with the factories, I zoomed out because of the cursor. Some of the graphs needed more labeling. | The graph about redlined areas had a ‘yes/no’ pie chart, and it was difficult to understand what that was actually answering. It was unclear and hard to grasp. | Having different colors across the graphs might be helpful because there were colors that tracked across the graphs, but the concepts weren’t shared. Maybe pick more intentional colors unless you are using two consistent concepts. |
| Did anything surprise you? | I am well aware of the relationship between NO2 and asthma but was more unaware that it was related to industrial production. Moreso associated NO2 with home sources of pollution and cars and things like that. | On the overall issue no, but was surprised about black adults more likely to have asthma in redlined areas was surprising. Was surprised that it was roughly 50-50, still. | The Hazelwood Initiative was new to me, I was not familiar with that. It was kind of a super local solution to a big problem. | 
| What would you change, if you could change one thing? | Wanted a little more detail from the paragraph about zoning policies. Maybe this was too vague.| Excluding that zoom in / zoom out visual for the map. The grade labeling of the map was confusing. It seemed to convey too much information and needs to be simplified to make sense. The intention did not seem super clear.| Maybe this is just me, but I might change the white border with the yellow border differently. Making the white take up more space might make the background less distracting.|

From this, I gleaned a few main points of improvement and made a few low-effort, high value changes such as removing the auto-zoom feature on the Tableau map. Additionally, I felt that I was targeting my audience correctly because everyone I interviewed understood the idea and most seemed interested in the Hazelwood Initiative. The big titles seemed really helpful for directing the flow of the piece, but I have a lot of aesthetic issues still that I think need working out.

### On Hazelwood
I chose the Hazelwood Initiative because I recently visited the neighborhood and met a number of its residents through a CMU event. One of the residents, Shauna (pseudonym), spoke about her experience living in the area and the issue of environmental racism- her solution was to help build community farms in the neighborhood. For my final, I am hoping to run this by Shauna and some other members of the community who have been working to remediate some of the issues faced in Hazelwood. Those conversations have not started yet as this neighborhood visit happened close to the deadline for this piece, but I hope to make contact soon. My hope is that this piece is informed by residents living in the neighborhood.

### In Class Crit
Next, I brought this draft to my classmates and asked a few questions:
##### What Worked?
They really liked the flow of the presentation.
##### What Didn't?
Increase size of labels for flourish chart, the donut chart font was too small.
Maybe add some text to frame the graphs more extensively.
##### What Questions Arose?
Curiosity about the impact this has had on people. Maybe add some more contextual information that frames the charts.
##### What New Inspiration Arose?
Could you include a news article that points out the headline for certain charts? Add some multimedia components, potentially.

### Changes for the Final
First, I will say that some of what I produce will be dependent on if I can get some conversations in with residents of Hazelwood. I have sent some messages out and hope to hear back from them soon. The results of those conversations, if they happen, will inform how I direct the narrative. Next, an itemized list based on the comments and the in-class critique:
* Add a bit more text framing some of the content in case people are left wanting more. I started simple but it seems like people were interested in seeing more about the history, and potentially about the outcomes in the community.
* Improve the labels for the donut charts to make their points clearer.
* Do some intentional palette selection for colors to help marry the story across phases.
* Provide a bit more context about "Why Hazelwood?" as people seemed interested, but a bit surprised.
* Provide some more context for health outcomes in Black communities. Maybe another visualization of some variety.
* Explore the science of NO2 and potential main sources of asthma in Black communities. There are many other sources of pollution that cause asthma in these neighborhoods (such as highways) which are potential main sources. I might be making a leap here in terms of identifying the actual source, though there is research which affirms the link between redlining and asthma.
