## Part 2- Taking a look at historical context
The following graph highlights the historical context of Greece's high debt loads as a proportion of their productivity. Year over year, it appears Greece experienced a steep spike in their debt loads, alongside Italy, Portugal, Spain, France, and Belgium. It appears that every nation experienced some sort of increase, though these nations displayed impressive increases. Most of these countries have taken on debts consistently above the OECD average, since the Great Recession (the graph starts in 2007 for comparability reasons).
